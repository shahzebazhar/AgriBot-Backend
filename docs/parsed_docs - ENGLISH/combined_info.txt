CULTIVATION:
Pearl millet cultivation depends on seasonal conditions.
Usually, four to five irrigations are sufficient.

DISEASES:
To protect Pearl millets from birds and rodents, scarecrows should be placed every three hours.
Cultivate the Pearl millets along with other farmers to reduce bird damage.

HARVESTING:
Harvest the Pearl millet by pressing the grains with your fingers. If they break with a sound, the Pearl millet is ready for harvest.
Cut the stalks with a sickle, leaving them one foot above the ground. Create raised platforms in the sun, at least one foot high from the ground, to prevent rainwater from collecting.
Allow the stalks to air dry daily until they are completely dry, then thresh them and separate the grains.
Store the dried grains in clean and dry warehouses, protecting them from insects.
