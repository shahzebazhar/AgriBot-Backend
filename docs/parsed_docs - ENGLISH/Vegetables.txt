BANDGOBHI (Cauliflower):
CULTIVATION:
For watering information, the first irrigation should be done at intervals of four days after the initial planting. After this, weekly irrigation should be carried out. When the crop is in the growing phase, irrigation should be done at intervals of 10 to 14 days.

DISEASES:
To protect the crop from attacking diseases and their carriers, such as American bollworm, cabbage butterfly, armyworm, and thrips, it is recommended to keep a vigilant eye and consult the agriculture department as soon as symptoms are observed.

FERTILIZERS:
To obtain a good yield of cauliflower, the following nutrients need to be applied per acre: nitrogen 45 kilograms, phosphorous 25 kilograms, and potassium 15 kilograms. These should be applied at the time of planting. During the mobile growth stage, one bag of DAP, one bag of potash, and half a bag of ammonium sulfate should be applied.

NURSERY:
One month after sowing the seeds in the nursery, apply urea to the soil around the plants. When cauliflower flowering starts, apply one bag of urea.

SOIL PREPARATION AND SOWING:
For successful cauliflower cultivation, choose well-draining soil with adequate organic matter and good water retention. Approximately one month before planting, mix 15 to 20 tons of organic manure into the soil and carry out irrigation properly. Control weeds by using herbicides.

Prepare the land and create furrows of suitable size for planting cauliflower.

For local varieties of cauliflower, consult the agriculture department for recommended varieties to cultivate.

HARVESTING:
To determine when the cauliflower is ready for harvest, observe the crop closely and harvest it when it reaches maturity.

BANGUN (Eggplant/Aubergine):

CULTIVATION:
For watering information, the second irrigation for transplanted seedlings in the field should be done after 3 to 4 days, followed by weekly irrigation. During the winter season or when there are weather fluctuations, the frequency of irrigation can vary. During the early stages, less water should be given at shorter intervals.

VARIETIES:
In Pakistan, there are various varieties of eggplants, including unique, exceptional, saffron, and delightful ones, suitable for different regions.

HARVESTING:
To determine the right time for harvesting eggplants, it is advisable to check the crop every third day once the fruit is ripe. The fruit should be harvested gently to avoid bruising, as this can affect the market value. One acre typically yields 20 to 25 tons of eggplants.

DISEASES:
Pests and diseases like nematodes and fruit rot can cause significant damage to eggplant crops. Nematodes can damage the root system, while fruit rot affects the quality of the produce. To protect the crop from these issues, use Furadan (zehar redo mill gold) as a soil treatment and choose resistant eggplant varieties. Insecticides like Chust Sela, Surkh Tela, Safaid Makhi, and treatments for nematodes and fruit rot should be used as soon as the infestation is noticed.

FERTILIZERS:
For successful eggplant cultivation, the soil should have good drainage and water retention properties. Plow the field once, followed by four to five plowings with a desi plow, and irrigate the field at least three times. One month before planting, apply 10 to 12 tons of well-rotted cow dung per acre and mix it thoroughly with the soil before planting. During transplantation, add four bags of superphosphate and one bag of ammonium nitrate to the soil and prepare it for planting. After transplanting, add a mixture of cow dung and green manure.

One month after transplantation, cultivate the field and add one bag of urea per acre. Continue to add ammonium nitrate or half a bag of urea every 3 to 4 weeks after the initial application.

PLANTING SCHEDULE:
For the first crop, sow eggplant seeds in the nursery in April and transplant them into the field starting in April. This crop yields from June to September. For the second crop, sow seeds in June and start transplanting in July and August. This season usually involves the cultivation of round eggplants. This crop yields from September to December. For the third crop, sow seeds in November and start transplanting in February, provided there is no risk of frost. This crop yields well into the winter season.

For successful eggplant cultivation, choose well-draining soil with good water retention properties. Plow the field once, followed by four to five plowings with a desi plow, and irrigate the field at least three times.

LAHSON (Garlic):

CULTIVATION:
For watering information, garlic should be planted in rows on leveled ground. The spacing between plant to plant can be 10cm, while the spacing between rows can be 20cm. The crop should be grown in well-drained soil, and after planting, it should be immediately irrigated. Subsequently, irrigate every 3 to 4 weeks, with the final irrigation occurring after 15 days as needed.

VARIETIES:
For local varieties of garlic, the pink variety is generally preferred, which has pink cloves. This variety typically yields 3 to 4 tons per acre and can be stored easily until the next season.

PLANTING SCHEDULE:
For information on planting garlic, it is usually planted in the second half of April. When the leaves become green and mature, it's a sign that the crop is ready. In the second week of April, lightly water the crop, and when the leaves begin to turn yellow, use a spade to dig up the bulbs.

HARVESTING:
To store garlic, spread it out in a dark place for 3 to 4 days. Once the outer skin of the bulbs starts to separate easily, separate the cloves, dry them thoroughly, and store them in a cool and dry place.

DISEASES:
Pests and diseases such as aphids, mealybugs, and leafhoppers can attack garlic. To protect the crop from these issues, use insecticides like Venda Phaphundi, Safundi Phapundi, Kanne, or a leaf canopy. These diseases can usually be controlled with appropriate chemicals as recommended by agricultural experts.

FERTILIZERS:
To achieve good garlic yield, the use of chemical fertilizers is essential. For garlic, you'll need 55 kg of nitrogen, 25 kg of phosphorus, and 50 kg of potash per acre. Use two bags of urea, one bag of DAP, and one bag of potash to meet the requirements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. Apply all the phosphorus and potash fertilizers during planting, while the remaining nitrogenous fertilizers should be applied in December after every 15 days.

SOIL PREPARATION AND SOWING:
Garlic can be cultivated in different types of soil, but well-drained and fertile soil with good water retention properties is ideal. For garlic cultivation, organic manure holds great importance. About one month before planting, mix 20 to 25 tons of well-rotted cow dung per acre into the soil and thoroughly blend it. If possible, apply lime through lablink before adding organic manure to the field. Plow the field once, followed by two or three plowings with a desi plow, and add sahaga (a type of natural fertilizer). Ensure that the soil is well-prepared and leveled.

PYAAZ (Onion):

CULTIVATION:
For information on onion cultivation, it's essential to pay attention to the weather conditions. Plant onions during the appropriate season.

VARIETIES:
For local onion varieties, Okara and Punjab are both known for producing high-quality onions suitable for all seasons. The onions from these regions have good color and a beautiful shape. Dark red onions are specifically grown for the winter season, while a new variety is being introduced for the autumn season.

PLANTING SCHEDULE:
For details on planting onions, the crop becomes suitable for harvesting approximately 14 to 18 weeks after transplantation, typically in April in Punjab. Stop irrigating the crop at least 2 weeks before harvesting. After harvesting, let the onions dry under the shade of a tree for 2 days, then store them in a cool, dry place. Onions can be stored for up to 6 months this way. Harvest onions when the leaves and neck become dry and start falling over.

DISEASES:
Onions can be susceptible to attacks from pests and diseases such as okra and thrips. To protect the crop from okra, mix 2 grams of khade in 6 liters of water and spray it. For thrips, mix 2 grams of thiamethoxam in 6 liters of water and spray it. The crop can also be susceptible to a pest called the "spit." This is a small, green insect, and appropriate measures should be taken to control it.
